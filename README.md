Cargo-Shipping-Game
===================

# Cargo ships, and the ocean.

#Introduction
You take possession of a container ship, and you need to make some money.

Three ports are available to you initially.

There is a variety of different container types to move around the world, all
with their own prices in different ports.

You can't just take your ship and sail alone though, you will need to hire
sailors to man your ship with you.

#Project Progress

Overall Progress:

Sailors: I feel like the sailor classes are mostly done and defined. I have some
minor changes to make, like the contract date stuff, but nothing huge.

Player's ship: I want to add health aspects to the portions of the ship, like the
engine and the like.

Ports: I will invariably add more objects to the ports, as time goes on.  Right
now it works pretty well.

Upgrade pathing: Not functional at this point.

Movement: Movement is in a stable place at this moment, but I eventually want to
implement a map and pathing that actually is aware of islands and coasts and stuff.

Boarding: Not implemented yet.

Weather: Currently exists in the game, but has no actual effect on anything.

# To-Do List

Place the locations and coordinates in their respective .properties files

Add in random events.

Clean up folders and file locations.

Work on boarded ship portions of game.

Work on upgrade and ship modification path.

Work on the game economy, rather than using random number generation.
